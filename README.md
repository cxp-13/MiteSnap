Hey PH 👋 I’m the founder of MiteSnap.

I built this after years of living in a tiny apartment in Shenzhen—no balcony, no elevator, just stairs to the rooftop every time I needed to dry a quilt. I realized I wasn’t alone.

MiteSnap combines AI + local support:
📷 Snap a photo of your bedding
🧠 AI analyzes material + weather to track mite risks
🤝 Connect with nearby people to help dry bedding

It’s designed for renters, students, busy people, and anyone sick of fighting humidity and mold.

Would love to hear your thoughts!
What’s the most annoying part of bedding care for you?
