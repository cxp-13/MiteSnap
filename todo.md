# Photo Upload to Supabase Storage Implementation Plan

## Current Codebase Analysis Summary

### Existing Supabase Setup ‚úÖ
- **Supabase Client**: Already configured in `/home/cxp/indi_dev/SunSpec/sun-spec/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- **Environment Variables**: Properly set up in `.env.local`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Dependencies**: `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.50.0 already installed

### Duvet-Related Components ‚úÖ
- **Main Dashboard**: `/home/cxp/indi_dev/SunSpec/sun-spec/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **"Add New Duvet" Modal**: Already implemented with basic photo upload UI
- **File Upload Logic**: Basic file selection and preview functionality exists (lines 76-86)

### Current Upload Functionality ‚úÖ
- **File Selection**: Working file input with image preview
- **Preview Generation**: FileReader implementation for image preview
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation for photo and location requirements
- **Missing**: Actual upload to Supabase storage

### Available Dependencies ‚úÖ
- **Supabase**: `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.50.0
- **Next.js**: v15.3.4 with Image component support
- **React**: v19.0.0 with hooks
- **TypeScript**: v5 for type safety

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Configure Supabase Storage Bucket üìã
- [ ] Create storage bucket in Supabase dashboard (named 'duvet-photos')
- [ ] Set up proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- [ ] Configure public access for uploaded images
- [ ] Test bucket accessibility

### 2. Enhance Supabase Client Configuration üìã
- [ ] Add storage-specific configuration to existing supabase client
- [ ] Create utility functions for file upload operations
- [ ] Add error handling for storage operations
- [ ] Implement file validation (size, type, etc.)

### 3. Update Dashboard Photo Upload Logic üìã
- [ ] Replace mock upload logic with actual Supabase storage upload
- [ ] Generate unique file names (timestamp + user ID)
- [ ] Implement upload progress indication
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Store file URLs in application state/database

### 4. Add File Upload Utilities üìã
- [ ] Create `/home/cxp/indi_dev/SunSpec/sun-spec/src/lib/storage.ts` helper file
- [ ] Implement file compression for large images
- [ ] Add file validation functions
- [ ] Create upload progress tracking
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed uploads

### 5. Database Integration üìã
- [ ] Update duvet data structure to include photo URLs
- [ ] Create database table for duvet records (if not exists)
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for duvet management
- [ ] Link uploaded photos to duvet records

### 6. UI/UX Improvements üìã
- [ ] Add upload progress bar
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop file upload
- [ ] Add multiple photo support per duvet
- [ ] Enhance error messaging
- [ ] Add loading states during upload

## Recommended Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Basic Upload Functionality**
1. Configure Supabase storage bucket
2. Create storage utility functions
3. Update existing modal to use Supabase upload
4. Test basic upload workflow

**Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
1. Add progress tracking and error handling
2. Implement file validation and compression
3. Create database integration for duvet records
4. Add multiple photo support

**Phase 3: Polish & Optimization**
1. Improve UI/UX with better loading states
2. Add drag-and-drop functionality
3. Optimize image handling and storage
4. Add comprehensive error handling

## Technical Requirements
- Supabase storage bucket setup
- File upload utilities with TypeScript support
- Integration with existing React component state
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Mobile-responsive file upload interface

## Files to Modify
- `/home/cxp/indi_dev/SunSpec/sun-spec/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Update upload logic
- `/home/cxp/indi_dev/SunSpec/sun-spec/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Add storage functions
- Create new: `/home/cxp/indi_dev/SunSpec/sun-spec/src/lib/storage.ts` - Upload utilities

## Current Status
üîç **Analysis Complete** - Ready to begin implementation
üìã **Next Step** - Configure Supabase storage bucket and begin Phase 1
